# Terraform AWS VPC Setup

This Terraform project creates an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment using modularized infrastructure components. It's designed to establish a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets, allowing for secure and controlled network access for your services.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to set up a structured AWS environment with the following key components:

- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud for network isolation.

- **Public Subnet**: A subnet with an Internet Gateway for instances that require direct internet access.

- **Private Subnet**: A subnet with a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway for instances needing internet access while maintaining a private network.

- **EC2 Instances**: Launch EC2 instances in both the public and private subnets.

- **Security Groups**: Define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed.

2. Clone this repository.

3. Modify the variables and settings in the respective module's `.tf` files to match your requirements.

4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.

5. Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.

6. Review the plan and confirm the changes when prompted.

## Modules

The project is organized into several modules:

- **VPC**: Manages the core VPC configuration.
- **Subnet**: Creates public and private subnets.
- **NAT Gateway**: Establishes the NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access.
- **Security Group**: Defines the security group rules for EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instance**: Launches EC2 instances in the public and private subnets.

## Customization

Modify the variables and settings in each module to fit your specific use case. You can also expand or enhance the infrastructure as needed.

## Maintenance

To make changes or update the infrastructure, edit the respective module's `.tf` files and run `terraform apply` after saving your changes.

## License
